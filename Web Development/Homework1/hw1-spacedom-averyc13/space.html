          <p>
            There are more stars in our universe than grains of sand in all of Earth's deserts
            and on all of its beaches. There are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky
            Way galaxy alone, 10% of which are similar to the Sun. Nearly a fifth of those
            Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized plant in the "habitable zone", meaning there are
            an estimated 4 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. That number balloons to
            40 billion if you include planets orbiting red dwarfs. The closest one? That would
            be Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri,
            a mere 4.2 light-years away. If you were traveling at the speed of the
            fastest-moving manmade object (the Parker Solar Probe), an amazing 68.6 km/s,
            it would still take 18,500 years to get there. So close, yet so far.

        <h2>Far Out Facts</h2>

          In space there is also an object known as a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/black_hole_description.html">
          black hole</a>. Black holes are so dense and have such a strong gravitational pull that
          they suck in everything around them, including light!
